# Week 9 is primarily conceptual and Packet Tracer-based.
# Containerlab cannot simulate wireless networks.
# This topology provides a wired backbone for practicing the
# infrastructure that supports wireless (VLANs, DHCP, trunking).

topology:
  nodes:
    # Core router (simulating gateway + DHCP for wireless VLANs)
    router1:
      kind: linux
      image: frrouting/frr:latest
      exec:
        - ip link set eth1 up
        - ip link set eth2 up
        # Corporate VLAN gateway
        - ip addr add 192.168.10.1/24 dev eth1
        # Guest VLAN gateway
        - ip addr add 192.168.20.1/24 dev eth2
        - sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

    # Corporate VLAN bridge
    corp-switch:
      kind: bridge

    # Guest VLAN bridge
    guest-switch:
      kind: bridge

    # Simulated corporate wireless client
